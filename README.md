# Libft

My own C library that will be used on my future C projects.
* This will be improved on the future.


## About the project

This is the first project of school 42, it's just the beginning of my training to become de software engineer.

In most of time in our formation we need to code on C and we are not allowed to use any of that highly useful standard functions that already exists.

So, this project is to re-write those functions, understand them and learn to use them.

Through this project, I will always be able to expand this list with my own fuctions to have a better lib.
